# Dotfiles

My personal configuration is for a Backend Developer, that loves to program in Ruby, and JavaScript.
I like to keep my configuration simple and clean, mostly for NeoVim, Tmux and Zsh.
I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage the dotfiles.


## Requirements

* Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm).
  * Install [Ruby](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby?tab=readme-ov-file#install)
  * Install [Node.js](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs?tab=readme-ov-file#install)

* Install Tmux running `brew install tmux`.
* Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
* Install stow running `brew install stow`.


## Fonts

I can live with the default fonts, but I have some favorite fonts that you can find under the `fonts` directory.

For Linux, just copy the fonts to `~/.local/share/fonts/`.
For MacOS, just double click the font file and install it.
